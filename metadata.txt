about=GoogleMapsStreetDock is a QGIS plugin that integrates Google Maps and Street View into a dockable browser panel.  
 By clicking on the QGIS map canvas, users instantly center the view on the clicked location with coordinates automatically transformed to WGS84 (EPSG:4326).  
 The plugin supports toggling between Map View and Street View within the panel, facilitating precise road network digitization and feature verification using real-world imagery directly inside QGIS.
